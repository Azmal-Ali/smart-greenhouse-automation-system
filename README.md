#project name

smart greenhouse automation system

# project overview

Traditional greenhouses require manual monitoring, which is time-consuming and often inefficient. This project solves the problem by automating the greenhouse environment using sensors, actuators, and IoT connectivity. It reduces human effort, saves resources, and improves plant growth.

# Tech Stack

Hardware

   NodeMCU ESP8266 / ESP32

   YL-69 + YL-38 Soil Moisture Sensor

   DHT11/DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor

   LDR / Light Sensor

   MQ-Series Gas Sensors (CO₂, O₂)

   Water Level Sensor

   Relay Module

   Submersible Water Pump

   Fan, Heater, Humidifier, Grow Lights

Software

   Arduino IDE (C/C++ for NodeMCU programming)

   Blynk IoT App (Mobile monitoring & control)

   ThingSpeak / Firebase (optional for data storage & visualization)

 # Features   

 Automated irrigation based on soil moisture

Temperature and humidity regulation using fan/heater/humidifier

Light management with grow lights

CO₂ and O₂ monitoring with ventilation control

Water level monitoring and alerts

Real-time monitoring and remote control via Blynk App

Low-cost, scalable, and eco-friendly solution

# System Workflow

Sensors collect real-time data.

NodeMCU processes data and makes decisions.

Actuators (pump, fan, heater, lights, etc.) adjust conditions automatically.

Data and alerts are sent to the Blynk app.

Users can monitor and control devices remotely.

# Usability

Farmers: Reduce manual labor and improve yield.

Urban Gardeners: Smart automation for home or rooftop gardens.

Researchers: Study controlled plant growth.

Commercial Farms: Large-scale monitoring and control with IoT.

# Scalability

Can be expanded with pH and nutrient sensors.

Cloud & AI integration for predictive analysis.

Multiple greenhouses connected to one dashboard.

# Potential Impact

Saves water, energy, and labor

Improves crop quality and yield

Reduces human errors

Supports sustainable agriculture
